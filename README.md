# ESP32 ASR33 controller

Direct control of an ASR33 and connection to MQTT

This uses ESP32-RevK and so has the commands and settings as per that library
https://github.com/revk/ESP32-RevK

Additional settings, e.g. setting/ASR33/[name]/[setting] [value]
- uart:	UART number
- tx:	Tx pin
- rx:	Rx pin
- pu:   Extra pulled up input pin, if extra pull up needed on rx, put in parallel
- on:	On pin (a low on this wakes up)(
- sonoff:	The topic to use for power on/off the teletype
- idle:	The number of seconds before powering off after printing done
- keyidle: The number of seconds before powering off in manual mode (i.e. on function not just printing)
- echo:	If echo on or off
- wru:	String to send for WRU
- ver:	Flag, if set, send version info for WRU
- ack:  Value of ACK - 0x7C in 1963, 0x06 in later editions
- cave: Flag, always play a game
- nodc4: ASR33 does not do DC2/DC4 so don't send to start/stop tape

Commands, e.g. command/ASR33/[name]/[command]
- on: Turn on now (automatically done if message to send)
- off: Turn off now (automatically done after idle delay)
- tx:	Raw 8 bit data to send to teletype
- text:	Text, adding carriage returns and setting even parity, and skipping utf-8 (print up arrow)
- punch: Data to punch, handles DC2/DC4 logic
- tape: Punch 5 hole lettering
- cave: Let's play a game

Status, e.g. status/ASR33/[name]/[status]
- power: If power on or off
- busy: If tx queue is getting full - don't send it busy

Events, e.g. event/ASR33/[name]/[event]
- rx:	Raw 8 bit data from teletype (one character at a time)
- line:	Text typed, parity stripped, a whole line of typed text

Can be connected using a 100 ohm resistor directly
(see https://www.revk.uk/2020/12/connecting-asr33-teletype-to-esp32.html)

Note:
- Typing WRU (^R) will response with wru string and version if either is configured/set
- Typing RU (^F) will run Colossal Cave - have fun
